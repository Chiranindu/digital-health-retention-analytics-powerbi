# Digital Health App – User Behavior & Retention Analytics

## Project Overview
This project presents a two-page Power BI dashboard focused on analyzing user behavior, subscription performance, and churn drivers within a digital health application.

The goal of this analysis was to understand why users churn, identify high-risk segments, and evaluate how engagement and billing models impact retention and revenue performance.

## Business Objectives
- Measure overall churn rate and revenue performance
- Identify lifecycle stages with the highest churn risk
- Analyze the impact of billing cycle on retention
- Compare engagement and support behavior between churned and active users
- Segment users based on revenue contribution and churn exposure

## Dashboard Structure
